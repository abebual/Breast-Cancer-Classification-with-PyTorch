# Breast Cancer Classification with PyTorch
In this project, we’ll build a classifier to train on 80% of a breast cancer histology image dataset. Of this, we’ll keep 10% of the data for validation. Using PyTorch, we’ll define a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), call it CancerNet, and train it on our images. We’ll then derive a confusion matrix to analyze the performance of the model to detect IDC breast cancer in histopathological images. Two classes will be detected, 0 and 1: 0 denotes absence of IDC and 1 denotes presence of IDC.
